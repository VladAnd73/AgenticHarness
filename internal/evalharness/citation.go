// citation.go proves, at Go level, the mechanism the real pipeline's

// slack-bug-investigation.md) will depend on: handed a claim plus a
// file:line pointer, can a spawned agent independently re-open that
// pointer and tell a real citation from a fabricated one?
//
// This deliberately does not reuse BuildReviewerRun: that function is
// tightly coupled to the dream pipeline's packet.json shape and
// dream.ReviewerBrief text, which has nothing to do with a citation
// check. It reuses only the genuinely generic infra from
// sandbox.go/session.go (Sandbox, copyFixtureRepo, AgentSpawner) and
// defines its own scenario/fixture shape.
